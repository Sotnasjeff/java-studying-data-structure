# Data Structure Study in Java

- This project is a Java's Data Structure implementation study, so I made it to understand better the data structures
  already created in **Java.util** and created some of them manually like **Tree, Queue and Stack**.

# How to run it locally
- First, you need to install Java SDK/JDK in your local machine.

# In case if you are using intellij IDE:
- You only need to go:
-      File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Plataform Settings > SDKs
- Click in Plus signal above saying 'add new sdk' and install SDK/JDK
- The dialog will appear in your front asking the version and the JDK, so I recommend to use version 11 coretto, you will find it as **coretto-11**
- After Downloading, set in the project structure the Language Level and put as "SDK Default" and click in apply
- Rebuild the project on gradle, if everything goes well, you are ready to play the project locally.
